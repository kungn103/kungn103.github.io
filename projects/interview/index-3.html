  <h1>getting to know &lt;<span class="name">jessie</span>&gt;</h1>

  <div class="introduction">I first met Jessie via zoom (how would we even explain that concept two years ago?) in our Core 1: Interaction class. We shared an elective briefly where we were the only two sophomores. Naturally we struck up a conversation with each other, not recognizing each other from zoom. It wasn’t until our in-person session that we later realized we were in the same Interaction class, and were paired to do an interview together. In this interview, I get to know Jessie better by asking her questions based on our prior brief conversations.<span class="intro-slash"> //// </span>

  <div class="question-container">
  	<span class="question">Hi Jessie. What was your favorite thing about growing up in Brazil?<span class="green-slash"> / </span></span>
  	<span class="answer">One of my favorite things about growing up in Brazil was the people around me. Even though I was new to the country and the entire culture, no one ever showed discrimination towards me, and always welcomed me with open arms. Also, I loved how the people in Brazil were so active on a daily basis. For instance, on a Sunday they would go for a jog or a bike ride with their family members or friends, then grab an açai bowl after, and have a lovely meal afterwards. They really emphasized the importance of bonding time with their loved ones. The people in Brazil really made my experience there special.<span class="pink-slash"> / </span></span>

    <span class="question">That’s great! I’m glad you had a great experience there. I think we often get so caught up in our lives that we forget to make time to bond with those closest to us. Were you super active before? If not, do you think the culture in Brazil has made you a more active person?<span class="green-slash"> // </span></span>
    <span class="answer">I think since I was young I was a really active person. I’ve always wanted to make funny jokes to my friends or sing along to songs or do crazy dances at home.<span class="pink-slash"> // </span></span>

    <span class="question">What’s the worst idea you’ve ever had? <span class="green-slash"> /// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">I’ve actually faced one of my worst ideas recently. I was planning on flying to LA to meet my boyfriend, however I was too eager and I didn’t even know my full schedule for class. I hadn't even figured it out and had booked the flight before I realized that I had a class. Therefore, I had to rebook it and reschedule it.<span class="pink-slash"> /// </span></span>

    <span class="question">Woah I was recently in LA to meet a friend too! A super short trip that was somewhat spontaneous. Have you ever done anything else like that?<span class="green-slash"> //// </span></span> 
    <span class="answer">Actually back in mid-March in 2020, when Covid started becoming really serious in Korea, I decided to fly to Brazil to surprise my friends. That was kind of like a surprise for me because it was very spontaneous and also for my friends and my family.<span class="pink-slash"> //// </span></span>

    <span class="question">When was the last time you surprised yourself?<span class="green-slash"> ///// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">Usually I don’t really surprise myself. I really enjoy surprising my family members and my friends instead. However, if I were to specifically choose the last time I surprised myself, I believe it would be when I decided to buy an iPad for myself as, like, a reward for working hard during the summer for my internship.<span class="pink-slash"> ///// </span></span>

    <span class="question">Yes! Treating yourself is definitely important. I also think your iPad will be sucha great tool for school and work from here on out. Where did you intern? What was the most valuable thing you learned?<span class="green-slash"> ////// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">I actually worked as a visual designer and photographer at camp SFS, which stands for Seoul Foreign School. The most valuable thing that I learned from this experience is how to treat children, and realizing how fast they can catch up to your actions and words.<span class="pink-slash"> ////// </span></span>

    <span class="question">Is there anyone you’d like to get closer to in your life, why? <span class="green-slash"> /////// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">I would love to get closer to my boyfriend's little sister. She's in second grade right now, and her name is Jacqueline.<span class="pink-slash"> /////// </span></span>

    <span class="question">That's great! Is there something that you’ve been meaning to do with her?<span class="green-slash"> //////// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">I've actually never met her in real life because I started dating my boyfriend when he was abroad with me in the United states, and she was in Hong Kong. So I never got the chance to meet her. However, I’m really excited to meet her either this winter or next summer.<span class="pink-slash"> //////// </span></span>

    <span class="question">What is something that you wish more people knew about you?<span class="green-slash"> ///////// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">Something others don’t know about me is that I am blood type A, which means I will be super shy when I first meet people. But once you get to know me you'll think I’m crazy.<span class="pink-slash"> ///////// </span></span>

    <span class="question">Oh wow. I didn’t even realize your blood type could dictate parts of your personality? When was the last time you met someone who changed your perception?<span class="green-slash"> ////////// </span></span>
    <span class="answer">Last summer, I met my friend Gabe and we've been friends for about a year. A couple months ago he told me that I was the least shy person when we first met. So I was a little surprised because all my life I thought I was blood type A, and was always super shy when I met new people, however it was really refreshing to hear that.<span class="pink-slash"> ////////// </span></span>

    <span class="question">That’s great. I like to think that our personalities can change and that we are our own worst critics. Thank you for answering all my questions - that’s all I’ve got for now. See you later!<span class="green-slash"> / </span></span>
