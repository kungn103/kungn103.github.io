    <h1>Spam (food)</h1>
    <div class="introduction">
      <p>Spam (stylized as SPAM) is a brand of canned cooked pork made by Hormel Foods Corporation. It was introduced by Hormel in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II.<span class="superscript">[1]</span> By 2003, Spam was sold in 41 countries on six continents and trademarked in over 100 countries.<span class="superscript">[2]</span></p>
      <p> Spam's basic ingredients are pork with ham added, salt, water, modified potato starch (as a binder), sugar, and sodium nitrite (as a preservative). Natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its tins on the production line.<span class="superscript">[3]</span> Many have raised concerns over Spam's nutritional attributes, in large part due to its high content of fat, sodium, and preservatives.<span class="superscript">[4]</span></p>

      <p>It has become the subject of a number of appearances in pop culture, notably a Monty Python sketch, which repeated the name many times, leading to its name being borrowed for unsolicited electronic messages, especially email.<span class="superscript">[5]</span></p>

  <div class="history">
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Spam was introduced by Hormel on July 5, 1937.<span class="superscript">[6]</span> The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America states that the product was intended to increase the sale of pork shoulder which was not a very popular cut.<span class="superscript">[6]</span></p>

    <p>Ken Daigneau, the brother of a company executive, won a $100 prize that year in a competition to name the new item.<span class="superscript">[7]</span> Hormel claims that the meaning of the name "is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Foods executives", but a popular belief is that the name is a contraction of "spiced ham".<span class="superscript">[6][8]</span></p>

    <p>The difficulty of delivering fresh meat to the front during World War II saw Spam become a ubiquitous part of the U.S. soldier's diet. It became variously referred to as "ham that didn't pass its physical", "meatloaf without basic training",<span class="superscript">[1]</span> and "Special Army Meat". Over 68,000 tonnes (150 million pounds) of Spam were purchased by the military before the war's end.<span class="superscript">[9]</span></p>

    <p>During World War II and the occupations that followed, Spam was introduced into Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific. Immediately absorbed into native diets, it has become a unique part of the history and effects of U.S. influence in the Pacific islands.<span class="superscript">[10]</span></p>

    <p>As a consequence of World War II rationing and the Lend-Lease Act, Spam also gained prominence in the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher later referred to it as a "wartime delicacy".<span class="superscript">[11][12]</span></p>

    <p>In addition to increasing production for the U.K., Hormel expanded Spam output as part of Allied aid to the similarly beleaguered Soviet Union.<span class="superscript">[13]</span> In his memoir Khrushchev Remembers, Nikita Khrushchev declared: "Without Spam we wouldn't have been able to feed our army."<span class="superscript">[6][14]</span></p>

    <p>Throughout the war, countries ravaged by the conflict and faced with strict food rations came to appreciate Spam.<span class="superscript">[15]</span></p>

    <p>The billionth can of Spam was sold in 1959,<span class="superscript">[16]</span> the seven billionth can was sold in 2007,<span class="superscript">[7]</span> and the eight billionth can was sold in 2012.<span class="superscript">[17]</span></p>

        <p>Domestically, Spam's chief advantages were affordability, accessibility, and extended shelf life.<span class="superscript">[9]</span> Statistics from the 1990s say that 3.8 cans of Spam were consumed every second in the United States,<span class="superscript">[18]</span> totaling nearly 122 million cans annually. It became part of the diet of almost 30% of American households, perceived differently in various regions of the country.<span class="superscript">[19]</span> It is also sometimes associated with economic hardship because of its relatively low cost.<span class="superscript">[1]</span></p>
        <p>Spam that is sold in North America, South America, and Australia is produced in Austin, Minnesota (also known as "Spam Town USA") and in Dubuque, Iowa.<span class="superscript">[20]</span> Austin, Minnesota also had a restaurant with a menu devoted exclusively to Spam, called "Johnny's SPAMarama Menu".<span class="superscript">[21]</span></p>

      <div class="hawaii">
        <h4>Hawaii</h4>
        <p>Spam is especially popular in the state of Hawaii, where residents have the highest per capita consumption in the United States. Its perception there is very different from on the mainland.<span class="superscript">[22]</span> Hawaiians sometimes call it "Portagee Steak".<span class="superscript">[23]</span></p>
        <p>A popular local dish in Hawaii is Spam musubi, where cooked Spam is placed atop rice and wrapped in a band of nori, a form of onigiri.[24] Varieties of Spam are found in Hawaii and Saipan that are unavailable in other markets, including Honey Spam, Spam with Bacon, and Hot and Spicy Spam.<span class="superscript">[25]</span></p>
        <p>Hawaiian Burger King restaurants began serving Spam in 2007 to compete with the local McDonald's chains (which also serve Spam).<span class="superscript">[10][26]</span> In Hawaii, Spam is so popular that it is sometimes referred to as "The Hawaiian Steak".<span class="superscript">[27]</span> There is even an annual Spam-themed festival on the island of Oahu that takes place every spring, known as the "Waikiki Spam Jam".<span class="superscript">[28]</span> Local chefs and restaurants compete to create new Spam-themed dishes, which are then sold in a massive street fair on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Hawaii was plagued by a rash of thefts of Spam.<span class="superscript">[29]</span> Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the magnitude of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved.<span class="superscript">[29]</span> This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.<span class="superscript">[29]</span></p>

        <p>In the Northern Mariana Islands, lawyers from Hormel have threatened to sue the local press for publishing articles alleging ill-effects of high Spam consumption on the health of the local population.<span class="superscript">[31][32]</span></p>

        <p>The United Kingdom has adopted Spam into various recipes. For example, recipes include Spam Yorkshire Breakfast, Spamish Omelette, and Spam Hash.<span class="superscript">[36]</span> Spam can also be sliced, battered and deep-fried into Spam fritters.<span class="superscript">[37]</span></p>

        <h4>Philippines</h4>
        <p>In the Philippines, Spam (currently distributed by The Purefoods-Hormel Company Inc.) is a popular food item and seen as a cultural symbol. As a former US colony, Spam reached the islands similar to how it reached Hawaii and Guam: as a result of World War II rationing. Spam is commonly eaten with rice (usually garlic fried rice) and a sunny-side up egg for breakfast. It is prepared and used in a variety of ways, including being fried, served alongside condiments, or used in sandwiches. It has also been featured in numerous Filipino fusion cuisine dishes including Spam burgers, Spam spaghetti, Spam nuggets, and others.<span class="superscript">[39][40][41][42]</span></p>
        <p>The popularity of Spam in the Philippines transcends economic class, and Spam gift sets are even used as homecoming gifts. There are at least ten different varieties of Spam currently available in the country and an estimated 1.25 million kilos of the meat is sold every year in the Philippines.<span class="superscript">[43]</span> The popularity among Filipinos has led to the creation of a version with sugar and annatto, Tocino-flavor Spam, made for the overseas Filipino market in the US and Canada.<span class="superscript">[44]</span> During the rescue efforts after Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in 2009, Hormel Foods donated over 30,000 pounds of Spam to the Philippine National Red Cross.<span class="superscript">[45]</span></p>

For the 70th anniversary of Spam in 2007, cans with special designs were sold in Japan due to its popularity, primarily in Okinawa.<span class="superscript">[49]</span> Following the March 2011 earthquake, Spam sales in Japan declined and Hormel shifted its focus to China,<span class="superscript">[47]</span> although Hormel did pledge to donate $100,000 along with cans of Spam for relief efforts.[50]</p>

        <h4>South Korea</h4>
        <p>Spam was widely consumed within South Korea during the Korean War,<span class="superscript">[52]</span> and its popularity led to the creation of the Spam kimbap (rice and vegetable filled seaweed roll) in Korean cuisine.<span class="superscript">[53]</span> Because of a scarcity of fish and other traditional kimbap products such as kimchi or fermented cabbage, Spam was added to a rice roll with kimchi and cucumber and wrapped in seaweed. Spam was also used by US soldiers in South Korea as a means of trading for items, services or information around their bases.[<span class="superscript">54]</span> </p>
        <p>In South Korea, Spam (Korean: 스팸; RR: seupaem, licensed from Hormel by CJ CheilJedang)[55] is popular[56] with a majority of the population.<span class="superscript">[57]</span> Today, South Korea produces and consumes more Spam than any other country except the United States.<span class="superscript">[58][59]</span></p>

    <p>Beginning in 1940, Spam sponsored George Burns and Gracie Allen on their radio program.<span class="superscript">[61]</span></p>
    <p>During World War II, Spam was not only eaten but was also incorporated into many other aspects of the war (grease for guns, cans for scrap metal, etc.); it was so prominent that Uncle Sam was nicknamed "Uncle Spam".<span class="superscript">[62]</span> Other terms influenced by the product's name include the European invasion fleet, or the "Spam Fleet". Furthermore, the United Service Organizations (USO) toured the "Spam Circuit".<span class="superscript">[9]</span> In 1943, comedian Suzette Tarri appeared as the harassed waitress character "Mrs Spam" in the British film Somewhere in Civvies.<span class="superscript">[63]</span></p>
    <p>In the United States in the aftermath of World War II, a troupe of former servicewomen was assembled by Hormel Foods to promote Spam from coast to coast. The group was known as the Hormel Girls and associated the food with being patriotic. In 1948, two years after its formation, the troupe had grown to 60 women with 16 forming an orchestra. The show went on to become a radio program where the main selling point was Spam. The Hormel Girls were disbanded in 1953.<span class="superscript">[64]</span></p>
    <p>Spam has long had a somewhat dubious reputation in the United States and (to a lesser degree) United Kingdom as a poverty food. The image of Spam as a low cost meat product gave rise to the Scottish colloquial term "Spam valley" to describe certain affluent housing areas where residents appear to be wealthy but in reality may be living at poverty levels.<span class="superscript">[65]</span></p>
    <p>Spam was featured in an iconic 1970 Monty Python sketch called "Spam".<span class="superscript">[6]</span> Set in a café which mostly served dishes containing Spam, including "egg and Spam, egg bacon and Spam, Spam egg sausage and Spam, Spam egg Spam Spam bacon and Spam ",<span class="superscript">[66]</span> the piece also featured a companion song. Because of its use in a line of a song in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the title of the musical version of the film became Spamalot.</p>
    <p>By the 1990s, Spam's perceived ubiquity led to its name being adopted for unsolicited electronic messages, especially spam email.<span class="superscript">[67]</span></p>
    <p>Spam is the subject of the "Weird Al" Yankovic song "Spam", which is a parody of the R.E.M. song "Stand".<span class="superscript">[68]</span></p>
    <p>Other offshoots of Spam in popular culture include a book of haikus about Spam titled Spam-Ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf. There is also a mock Church of Spam, and a Spam Cam which is a webcam trained on a can of decaying Spam.<span class="superscript">[69]</span></p>
    <p>Spam is referred to in Island of the Sequined Love Nun by Christopher Moore, where SPAM is explained as Shaped Pork Approximating Man, which was used to explain its popularity amongst Pacific Island Cannibals.<span class="superscript">[70]</span></p>
    <p>The Pumpkin Spice flavour, introduced in September 2019, has gained the attention of the media and public.<span class="superscript">[71]</span></p>

      <p>Spamarama was a yearly festival from 1978 to 2007 in Austin, Texas which had a peak attendance of 14,000. The themed events included a Spam cook-off (to contrast with Texas chili cook-offs) and the Spamalymplics including a "Spam toss" and a Spamburger (a 12-ounce portion on a bun) eating contest.
